## ðŸª„ Introduction

This project focuses on understanding and managing **Oracle Multitenant Databases**, which allow multiple pluggable databases (PDBs) to run under a single container database (CDB).  
The main goal was to practice creating, deleting, and monitoring pluggable databases using both **SQL commands** and **Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)**.  

The assignment is divided into three main tasks:
1. Creating a new PDB.  
2. Deleting an existing PDB.  
3. Monitoring databases using OEM.  

Through these tasks, the student demonstrates hands-on skills in **database creation, management, and monitoring** within Oracleâ€™s multitenant environment.

### ðŸ§  Task 1 â€“ Create a New Pluggable Database

#### Objective  
To create a new pluggable database named `sa_pdb_27399` from the seed PDB.

#### SQL Code
```sql


 CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE sa_pdb_27399
    ADMIN USER Sandrine_plsqlauca_27399 IDENTIFIED BY sandra123
    FILE_NAME_CONVERT = (
    'C:\APP\ADMINISTRATOR\PRODUCT\21C\ORADATA\XE\PDBSEED\',
    'C:\APP\ADMINISTRATOR\PRODUCT\21C\ORADATA\XE\SA_PDB_27399\'
    );
```
